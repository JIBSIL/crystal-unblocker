Method 3:
*This is a complex installation. Only do this if you are on Windows or Linux as the program we are going to use does not run on Chromebook. To run this installation on chromebook, look in 2extra.
*However, this installation will be more updated than the ones on the mirrors.
*This installation specific to the Lubuntu Linux operating system. However, it should work on other operating systems if you know what you’re doing
Open your terminal. On Lubuntu, go to the home button, hover over System Tools, and click the terminal.
Install Git. Run (Linux only) sudo apt install git, and enter the administrator password (if you are using a CrystalVM, it is automatically set to password). Usually, this will output an error message about Git already being installed. Ignore this and move on to the next step. If you are on Windows, find the .exe download from the Git official website at (Git official website) and install
Clone our project. Run git clone (our project) in the folder you want to install it in and wait for it to load.

Update information:
After an update is released, it will come to our GitHub project first in the Releases. To use this installation, look to Method 3. Then it will come to our Primary and Redundant mirrors, then to the rest. Some mirrors will be outdated. Compare the version that you downloaded to the latest version (see log at the bottom of this page) if you want the latest patches and updates. See the log for all of the details.

Server information:
We have 2 servers currently, Alpha and Beta. Alpha is an all-purpose server, currently running virtual machines to test new features. Alpha also runs game hosting, so it might have a lot of load sometimes. Alpha sports 32 gigabytes of RAM, 2 intel Xeon X5650 processors and a lot of storage space. Beta is our web server. It is currently in the testing phase, but we will post it when we create the website.
